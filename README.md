# llvm-sys-featured

Rust bindings to LLVM's C API.

This is essentially a mirror of [llvm-sys], except that instead of using
separate crates.io releases for each LLVM version, this crate uses Cargo
features. Currently, the goal is that with the `llvm-8` feature you get
exactly `llvm-sys` version 80.2.0, with the `llvm-9` feature you get exactly
`llvm-sys` version 90.1.0, and with the `llvm-10` feature you get exactly
`llvm-sys` version 100.1.1.

## Usage

Add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`, selecting the feature
corresponding to the LLVM version you want:

```toml
[dependencies]
llvm-sys-featured = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["llvm-10"] }
```

Currently, the supported LLVM versions are `llvm-8`, `llvm-9`, and `llvm-10`.

There must be the corresponding LLVM version available on your system.
By default, `llvm-sys-featured` will look for `llvm-config` on `PATH` to find
a system-wide copy of LLVM and use that if it is compatible.
Alternately, you can set the environment variable `LLVM_SYS_FEATURED_PREFIX`
with the path (install prefix) to a compiled and installed copy of the
libraries, which will be used instead.

If you want to use `llvm-sys-featured` as a drop-in replacement for
`llvm-sys` (keeping the `llvm-sys` name in your code), you can use Cargo's
[dependency renaming] feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
llvm-sys = { package = "llvm-sys-featured", version = "0.1.0", features = ["llvm-10"] }
```

## Documentation

Documentation for this crate's API can be found at
[docs.rs](https://docs.rs/llvm-sys-featured).
However, most of the interfaces do not have detailed descriptions there, as
they are simply bindings to the corresponding LLVM C API interfaces; refer to
the [LLVM documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/) for more information,
particularly the [generated API documentation](https://llvm.org/doxygen).

See the `examples` directory in this repository for API examples; these
are exactly the same as the examples provided by [llvm-sys].

## Safe bindings

We recommend that most users not use this crate directly, but instead use one
of the following safe, "Rusty" APIs for LLVM:
  * [llvm-ir](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-ir)
  * [Inkwell](https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell)

## LLVM compatibility

Currently, this crate supports LLVM 8, LLVM 9, and LLVM 10. (See
[Usage](#usage).)

Like [llvm-sys], this crate checks that the LLVM version being used matches the
one selected via Cargo features (or crate version in `llvm-sys`'s case).
This is because the LLVM [C API stability guarantees][c-api-stability] are
relatively weak.

[c-api-stability]: http://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#c-api-changes

As an exception, like [llvm-sys], this crate allows to use a newer LLVM
version with older bindings, which should be safe in almost all cases; for
more information, see comments in the [llvm-sys] README.
This behavior can be disabled by either selecting the `strict-versioning`
feature on this crate, or by setting the environment variable
`LLVM_SYS_FEATURED_STRICT_VERSIONING`; in either case, this crate will then
enforce that the LLVM version being used exactly matches the one selected via
Cargo features.

## Downloading LLVM

LLVM can be acquired from your system package manager on most systems; but if
you want a newer version of LLVM, you can download it from the LLVM [Download
page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html). On Debian and Ubuntu systems,
you can also get the latest versions from `apt` by following [these
instructions](https://apt.llvm.org/).

[llvm-sys] README.

## Credits

At least 99% of the code in this crate is taken directly from [llvm-sys],
so a big thanks to its author Peter Marheine, who deserves all the credit for
the excellent LLVM bindings.

This crate, like [llvm-sys], is licensed under the MIT License. That means
you're free to adapt and redistribute this crate with very few restrictions,
just like how this crate adapts and redistributes [llvm-sys].
